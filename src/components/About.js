        <h2>Made with React.JS</h2>
        <p style={{textAlign:'center', width:'40%', color:'azure'}}>I made this website in 4 days. But these were no ordinary 4 days. At the same time I needed to prepare our project for the final presentation and demo for our lectores. Also this week was the last week before our finals. So I also needed to study for those. Considering all it turned out okay IMO. But now that I am done with it I could have chosen a beter time. Maybe then it would have turned out better. But I need to find an internship so I could not have waited for after our finals that would be too late. (does anyone read the about page?)</p>
